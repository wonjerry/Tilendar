## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```sh
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

```sh
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

```sh
npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## Javacript Style Guide.

We'll follow [Airbnb style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

## Formatting Code Automatically

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for JavaScript, CSS and JSON. With Prettier you can format the code you write automatically to ensure a code style within your project. See the [Prettier's GitHub page](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for more information, and look at this [page to see it in action](https://prettier.github.io/prettier/).

To format our code whenever we make a commit in git, we need to install the following dependencies:

```sh
npm install --save husky lint-staged prettier
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add husky lint-staged prettier
```

### Lint Configure For Javascript Style Guide.

Open the VScode configure and than just copy and paste the below.

```json
// Format a file on save. A formatter must be available, the file must not be auto-saved, and editor must not be shutting down.
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
// Enable/disable default JavaScript formatter (For Prettier)
"javascript.format.enable": false,
// Use 'prettier-eslint' instead of 'prettier'. Other settings will only be fallbacks in case they could not be inferred from eslint rules.
"prettier.eslintIntegration": true
```
